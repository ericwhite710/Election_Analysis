## Challenge Summmary
Formulating Python code is not an easy task. while doing this challenge some new skills that were picked up involved new syntax's and how to formulate more code. Having to place that code in a file using a different file was an early challenge, not so easily understood. Doing the skill drills and find the proper decimal value was also a learning curve and helped establish some new skills picked up in this challenge. Also seeing that in some spot that tabbing and print need to be placed in the correct spots or you wouldn't get the right values, overall a lot was learned.
